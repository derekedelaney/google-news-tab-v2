# NewsTab Chrome Extension.

A basic new tab page with news under the search bar

The extension uses the Google News RSS feed to get news from topics.
It also adds the current weather of the current location in the corner of the screen.
If there is an available google doodle of the current date from https://www.google.com/doodles, then It will use that as the logo instead of the google logo, similar to the google home page.
